Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Overview
This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a dataset to understand its structure, quality, and underlying patterns. The analysis helps in identifying trends, handling missing values, detecting outliers, and preparing the data for further machine learning tasks.

 Objectives
Understand dataset dimensions and feature types
Identify and handle missing or duplicate values
Analyze data distributions and relationships
Detect outliers and anomalies
Extract insights to support feature selection

Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

 Key Outcomes
Improved understanding of dataset quality
Identification of important feature relationships
Cleaned dataset ready for modeling

Conclusion:
EDA is a crucial step in data analysis. This project provides valuable insights that help in making informed decisions during feature engineering and model development
